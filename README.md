# micro:bit controller board
Orginally comissioned by Electronics Made Easy (Singapore) and released under the MIT License.

# Features
* Through-hole components means that a few can be soldered up quickly with just an iron.
* Basic sensors which act as a all-in-one kit to explore the micro:bit without requiring messy alligator clips or breadboards
* Listed pinouts on the board for ease of programming

# Components

| Components  | Pinouts |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| LED (5)  | 8,9,10,11,12 |
| LDR  | 2  |
| Buzzer  | 0  |
| Potentiometer  | 1  |
| RGB LED  | 13,14,15  |
| Tactile Buttons | 3,4,6,7  |

# Possible Improvements

1. SMD components will allow the board to be held easier
2. Headers for pins that are not used
3. Neopixels on board
